- "g", "G" for first line, last line
- maybe "t" to toggle between wall-clock and sync display for take info display
- export to cue maybe?
- export to simple "timestamp label" format
- export to simple takes per sentence format
- processor that goes sentence by sentence and grabs the best takes and edits
  the original recording into only the choice cuts. Configurable space between
- _maybe_ a coverage mode that shows color of best take directly in sentences?
- ":" to jump to particular ID
- "V" to select all sentences in a line
- "/" to search, "n" to search forward, "N" to search backward
- "?" to show keybinding help
- "Ctrl-N" to start a new session (maybe with confirmation)
- "Ctrl-O" to open a list of sessions for this file and pick one (probably just
  exec self with other file so I don't have to worry about reinitializing)
- "c" to add a text comment to a take. Not sure where I export this to... so maybe useless
- "C" to add file-level comment describing the session, to show up in the Ctrl-O session list

Done:
- "m" to expand to the selection of a superset take, or to toggle back
- unrecorded sentence state display
- Ctrl-S to stop / clear the sync ("S", Ctrl-S reserved)
- "." for most-recent take
- take time-range display
- actual event log, save and resume
