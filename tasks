- "g", "G" for first line, last line
- maybe "t" to toggle between wall-clock and sync display for take info display
- export to cue maybe?
- export to simple "timestamp label" format
- export to simple takes per sentence format
- processor that goes sentence by sentence and grabs the best takes and edits
  the original recording into only the choice cuts. Configurable space between
- _maybe_ a coverage mode that shows color of best take directly in sentences?
- ":" to jump to particular ID
- "V" to select all sentences in a line
- "/" to search, "n" to search forward, "N" to search backward
- "?" to show keybinding help
- "[" and "]" to jump to earliest and latest sentence that has a take.
   Probably "[" will always be the same as "g", but not necessarily.
	Often "]" will be the same as ".", but not always, like if I go back to
	re-record something
- "{" and "}" to jump to next line
- "^" and "$" to go to first and last sentence in line
- "v" visual mode. All of the movement commands do the same thing, but they all
  stretch the selection to encompass the existing range and also where we've
  moved to.
  So "vjv" would be the same as "J". But "vgGv" would select the whole file.
  And "v[]V" the whole segment with takes
  "v}}}v" would be the next 3 lines. "v^$v" would be "V"
  "v:13v" would select from here to line 13, I guess.
- "Ctrl-N" to start a new session (maybe with confirmation)
- "Ctrl-O" to open a list of sessions for this file and pick one (probably just
  exec self with other file so I don't have to worry about reinitializing)
- "c" to add a text comment to a take. Not sure where I export this to... so maybe useless
- "C" to add file-level comment describing the session, to show up in the Ctrl-O session list
- "P" to play the best takes of a selection (like the export).
  That's not "of the takes that cover this selection pick the best as play
  it", it's more like "of all the sentences in this take, pick the best of
  each", like the choice take export does.
  This way we can preview just a portion without doing a full export and then
  finding where our takes are in it...
- If my different syncs are differently offset, then a single global offset may
  not be enough... it may be the case where all of the ones from this sync are
  in sync, and all the ones from these other syncs are wrong. Unsure how I'd
  like to fix that, so for now I'm ignoring it and hoping it never comes up.
  Current system handles equally good syncs, with a systematic offset.
  I could maybe have the FineTune box have multiple sync bars (only the syncs
  with takes that use them). Then I could wiggle multiple of them together, or
  tweak the separately...

  Unsure, and again it's easier to just hope that good syncing alone will fix this.
- I _may_ want the ability to tweak a single take one way or the other. Like if
  I hit the end take button too late or something. This is getting a bit dicey
  though and may just be handled better in the edit...


Done:
- "m" to expand to the selection of a superset take, or to toggle back
- unrecorded sentence state display
- Ctrl-S to stop / clear the sync ("S", Ctrl-S reserved)
- "." for most-recent take
- take time-range display
- actual event log, save and resume
- I should be able to interrupt playback by scrolling, picking a new take, or
  when adjusting the fine-tune
